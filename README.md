# Temperature Converter App

The Temperature Converter App is a simple C++ program designed to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
It provides an interactive command-line interface for users to input temperatures in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and receive accurate conversions.

## Features

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion**: Allows users to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- **Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion**: Supports the conversion of temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

## Usage

1. Run the program in your preferred C++ environment.
2. Select the conversion option:
   - Enter `1` to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
   - Enter `2` to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
3. Input the temperature value as prompted.
4. The program will display the converted temperature value.

## Getting Started

To use this application:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled program in your terminal or command prompt.

## Code Overview

The program provides a user interface for choosing between Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius conversions. 
It takes user inputs for the temperature value and computes the conversions using standard temperature conversion formulas.

## Example

An example interaction with the program:

```bash
Choose from following options:
1. Celsius to Fahrenheit.
2. Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Enter your option: 1

Enter the temperature in Celsius: 25

Temperature in degree Fahrenheit: 77 F
```

## Acknowledgements

This program was created to demonstrate basic temperature conversion concepts in C++ and serves as a starting point for similar applications.
